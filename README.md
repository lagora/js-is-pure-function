# js-is-pure-function

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lagora/js-is-pure-function.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lagora/js-is-pure-function)

A simple and easy way to evaluate if a function answer the following constraints:
  - The function always take arguments (at least one)
  - The function always return a result (at least different from undefined)

As of now, it's purely experimental, and more verifications are to come (namely, on the body of the function).
